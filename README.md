StoreToDrive is a small tool that lets you store files* that you see on websites onto your Google Driveâ„¢ with a single click from the context menu.

This extension is a result of the GDG DevFest Zurich 2012 Hackathon, where it won the first prize. It's a collaborative effort by Misha Kupriyanov, Gerwin Sturm, Anatoli Leuchanka, Jean-Marie Bise and Martin Matysiak.

The extension uses the great OAuth 2.0 library for Chrome Extensions by Boris Smus (Google): smus.com/oauth2-chrome-extensions

To use the extension, right click on the file you want to store and select "Store on Google Drive". A notification will appear once the file has been stored.
